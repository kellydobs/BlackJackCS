General Rules:

The game should be played with a standard deck of playing cards (52).

The house should be dealt two cards, hidden from the player until the house reveals its hand.

The player should be dealt two cards, visible to the player.

The player should have a chance to hit (i.e. be dealt another card) until they decide to stop or they bust (i.e. their total is over 21). At which point they lose regardless of the dealer's hand.

When the player stands, the house reveals its hand and hits (i.e. draw cards) until they have 17 or more.

If dealer goes over 21 the dealer loses.

The player should have two choices: "Hit" and "Stand."

Consider Aces to be worth 11, never one.

The app should display the winner. For this mode, the winner is who is closer to a blackjack (21) without going over.

Ties go to the DEALER.

There should be an option to play again. This should start a new game with a new full deck of 52 shuffled cards and new empty hands for the dealer and the player.
